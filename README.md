# js-test
Test for javascript skills

1. install and run bower
2. get all dependencies
3. run your environment in local

##Tasks
The goal of this test is to evaluate your JS skills. Open `index.js` and refactor the whole code to your most beautiful way.

Thing to include in your refactor:

1. Avoid duplications
2. Use coherent names in your variables or function. Use camelCase all the time
3. Make the whole thing faster by optimizing functions
4. Think OBJECT ORIENTED

##Important notes
- Start the file with your name in the comments
- Clearly comment your code as we can understand what you are trying to do at each step of the script
- When done, do not commit on another repo/fork
- ZIP the whole folder and send it back to us - add your name is the ZIP filename

You should be able to finish the test after 1 hour. If you are really good, it will take you 15 minutes.

Good luck
